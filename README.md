### 🗺️ The User's Journey  
> I’m a curious computer science student with a passion for shaping the future of technology. I want to explore not just the innovations themselves, but also the pros and cons of what happens when technology advances and intertwines with human society.

> My journey into this field started early. As a kid, I dreamed of transforming from a weak and ordinary person into someone extraordinary—someone who left a meaningful mark on the world. But as I grew up, reality hit me hard… harder than my laptop fan during a Python infinite loop.

> I realized that life doesn’t always go as planned. And that’s okay. I don’t need to impress or prove myself to others—what matters is proving to myself that I’m becoming the best version of me.

> And now I’m on a journey of learning—diving into code, solving bugs, and occasionally questioning my life choices at 3 AM while staring at an error that was just a missing semicolon. I’m building skills, breaking code (sometimes on purpose), and shaping my mind to one day shape the world… or at least get my programs to run without Googling the error message every five minutes.
